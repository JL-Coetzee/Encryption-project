# Encryption-project
Creating encryption and decryption methods for this group project required creating both bespoke and conventional algorithms (DES, AES, Blowfish, and Twofish). Image, text, zip, and PowerPoint files may all be encrypted and decrypted using this application. Documentation is included. Python was primarily used.
